//Adding string values together
"Followers: + 55";
console.log("Followers" + "55");//result = Followers: 55. However, why not log consol.log (Followers: 55)? Why would we add 10 and 55 to give us 1055, why not just log 1055 to start with? Also, if we need this number to update based on user input, what variable would we use? Let? Var? Something else? Why would we need to manually put in numbers? //button funcion @likes document id likes box
//Another example
const label = "Post:" + "13";
console.log(label)
 // = is variable assignment operator. What is variable assignment? Storing a value inside a variable.
